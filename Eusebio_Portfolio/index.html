  			<h2>Unit 2</h2>
        
        <p>This website includes 
        examples of my work in Ms.
        Chang's Web Design and
        Development I class. It 
        also includes (below) on what 
        I learned in each unit of
        the course.</p>

        <p><img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/W-10-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="W"/>
        ith this project I learned that there is so much diversity around the school and that everyone has atleast one thing that they are interested in when it comes to career and tech education. Doing this project with the group has been an experience and would gladly do this again. Glen has been doing a good job maintaining the camera while Shareen did a lot of the editing for the group. Me and Isaiah have been filming around and have been getting a lot of the footage. Overall I think the project was great and a good learning experience for all.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a>Shows the education all around the school</a></li>
          <li><a>Anybody can do it as long as you want to do it</a></li>
          <li><a>All are equal and are treated with respect</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unit 3</h3>

        <p>
          In this journey 3 I have learned a lot about CSS and the index page. We have been undersanding how to style the web page and how it can result to make something organized and techniques. This journey was a great way dealing wit CSS and styles for the index page. We have added navs and many more styles by floating mmany of the frames.

          <h4>Unit 4</h4>

          <p>What I have learned during this journey is that we have learned a lot about photoshop. It was a very difficult task to complete as it was very time consuming. All in all, it was fun and very enjoyable.</p>

          <h5>Unit 5</h5>

          <p>What I have learned in this unit is that there are many ways to do things in the javascript files. It taught us how to style it and how to input the clock. The clock was the highlight of this.</p>

          <h6>Unit 6</h6>

          <p>What I have learned about this project is that there are many ways to set up the organizer for buying something and how the Javascript can really help a lot when it comes to the code you write an how it does.</p>
